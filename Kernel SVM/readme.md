Mainly this algorithm will work on the dataset which got not linear separable data. We will be using a higher dimension mapping to plot the nonlinear data to linear and get back to the original functionality. 

The disadvantage in this method is highly compute intensive and it requires more time to process which makes this model less reliable. 
So we will use the guassian RBF kernel function for this.

Finding the right sigma value will improve the predictions. 

High performance on nonlinear problems, not
biased by outliers, not sensitive to overfitting.
