Unlike regression where you predict a continuous number, you use classification to predict a category. There is a wide variety of classification applications from medicine to marketing. Classification models include linear models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and nonlinear ones like K-NN, Kernel SVM and Random Forests.
In this part, you will understand and learn how to implement the following Machine Learning Classification models:
1.	Logistic Regression
2.	K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
3.	Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4.	Kernel SVM
5.	Naive Bayes
6.	Decision Tree Classification
7.	Random Forest Classification
