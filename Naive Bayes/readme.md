Naive bayes Theorem:
It is a classification technique based on Bayes' Theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors. 
In simple terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.


P(├ A┤|B)=(P(├ B┤|A)*P(A))/P(B)
