It helps to find the best boundary line or regressor line for the specified model. 
Maximum margin(Maximum margin Hyperplane) is used to find the best fit line here. 

Support vectors would be plotted and the odd one out inthe entire series compared with the negative hyperplane and positive hyperplane. SVM tries to learn from that distance and keeps the model more effective.

Performant, not biased by outliers,
not sensitive to overfitting


Not appropriate for non linear problems, not
the best choice for large number of features
